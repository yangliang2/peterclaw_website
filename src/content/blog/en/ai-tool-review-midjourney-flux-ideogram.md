> When AI image generation shifts from "toy" to "production tool," choosing the right one means eliminating 80% of post-production rework — but between Midjourney's artistry, Flux's photorealism, and Ideogram's typography, which blade deserves your budget?

---

## Review Background

In 2026, the AI image generation market has entered an era of **professional specialization**. Midjourney v7 (released April 2025) remains the byword for artistic quality; Black Forest Labs' Flux family (FLUX.2 Pro/Max/Flex/Klein, iterating from late 2025 to early 2026) has risen rapidly on the strength of open-source distribution and extreme photorealism; while Ideogram 3.0 (released March 2025) has built an irreplaceable moat around the hard problem of **text inside images**.

The unique premise of this review is that **these three tools have fundamentally different product philosophies**. Midjourney strives for "so beautiful it doesn't look real"; Flux strives for "so real it looks photographed"; Ideogram strives for "the text must be correct." This means there is no "best" tool — only the one best suited to your scene.

This review is based on the following sources:

- **Public benchmarks**: ZSky AI March 2026 ten-thousand-image test, AI Video Bootcamp 30-prompt standardized comparison, Melies 20-model horizontal review
- **Community testing**: Reddit r/midjourney, r/StableDiffusion, designer threads on X/Twitter, high-frequency discussions in Chinese "AI Exploration" circles
- **Official docs**: Midjourney V7 parameter guide, Black Forest Labs FLUX.2 technical whitepaper, Ideogram API documentation
- **Test period**: 2026-05-15 to 2026-05-25 (ten days)
- **Methodology**: Generating and comparing outputs on each tool's official platform or authorized API using identical prompts

Target readers: designers, content creators, indie developers, and e-commerce operators who need AI-generated images for real work.

## Review Dimensions

This review focuses on five core dimensions — all directly tied to real-world workflows:

1. **Image quality (artistic / photorealistic / detail)** — visual ceiling across different style scenarios
2. **Prompt adherence** — whether the AI follows your description for composition, color, and element placement
3. **Chinese prompt support** — whether direct Chinese descriptions yield expected results without translation中介
4. **Pricing & quotas** — full-lifecycle costs from free to heavy usage
5. **Commercial licensing** — copyright ownership, commercial scope, and legal risk of generated content

In addition, this review includes a **"same prompt, three tools" comparison** using four typical scenarios to visually demonstrate the differences.

## Midjourney v7: Overview

Midjourney v7, released April 2025, is the first delivery of David Holz's team's "completely new architecture." Compared to V6, V7 is not a simple quality bump but a structural rebuild — allowing it to maintain artistic dominance while patching some realism gaps.

**Key features**:
- **Omni Reference**: Replaces V6's `--cref`, supporting character consistency with strength control from 75 to 600+
- **Draft Mode**: 10x faster sketch mode for rapid concept exploration
- **Default Personalisation**: Automatically learns your aesthetic preferences
- **Video generation**: Supports 5-21 second clips (but extremely expensive, not recommended as primary use)
- **Web app**: Finally no Discord required; browser-based operation

**Pricing** (May 2026):
- Basic: $10/month, ~200 Fast GPU images
- Standard: $30/month, ~900 images + unlimited Relax mode
- Pro: $60/month, ~1800 images + Stealth mode (images not published to community gallery)
- Mega: $120/month, ~3600 images
- **No free tier, no free trial**

### Pros

**Artistic quality remains the industry ceiling.** In AI Video Bootcamp's 30-prompt standardized test, V7 scored highest (28/30) in "artistic impact" and "cinematic feel." Skin texture, fabric folds, and light atmosphere in V7 reach a level where no post-processing is needed before delivery. For illustration, concept art, fashion photography, and social visuals, Midjourney's "defaults look stunning" is hard for other tools to match.

**Omni Reference pushes character consistency across the usability threshold.** In testing, character sequences generated at Omni Reference 300-500 strength maintained facial consistency across 5-6 images. Combined with Style Reference dual-tab locking, it can produce character sets suitable for brand IP. While Nano Banana Pro still leads in pure consistency, Midjourney's overall quality makes Omni Reference a "good enough and beautiful" choice.

**Draft Mode fundamentally changes workflow.** Previously, concept exploration in Midjourney meant waiting 30-60 seconds per image. Draft Mode compresses this to 3-5 seconds while consuming half the GPU quota. This means 2x more iterations on the same budget — for ad-creative teams that need extensive A/B testing, this is the most direct cost saving.

**Community ecosystem and prompt sharing are hidden assets.** Midjourney's public gallery (unless Pro Stealth is enabled) means you can directly view, copy, and learn from top global creators' prompts. For users still learning prompt engineering, this is more effective than any tutorial.

### Cons

**Text rendering is a hard weakness.** While Ideogram 3.0 achieves 90-95% text accuracy, Midjourney V7 sits around 71%. If you need images with titles, logos, or slogans (posters, banners, covers), Midjourney will likely disappoint — "Fresh Brew Daily" becoming "Frehs Bew Dially" is the norm.

**Prompt adherence is "too free."** Midjourney's aesthetic optimization will "enhance" your prompt's visual presentation — usually a good thing, but when you need precise control over composition, color, or element placement, its "artistic impulse" becomes trouble. In testing, an e-commerce prompt requesting "product on the left, 40% white space on the right for text" produced centered products in two of three generations.

**No API (as of May 2026).** This means you cannot integrate Midjourney into automated design pipelines, A/B testing systems, or your own SaaS products. All operations must be manual via the official web app or Discord.

**Pricing is unfriendly for heavy users.** The Basic plan's ~200 Fast GPU images is insufficient for designers needing 20-30 concept images daily; Standard ($30) or even Pro ($60) is the realistic starting point. Compared to other tools, Midjourney's subscription门槛 is rigid — no pay-per-use, no free tier.

---

## Flux: Overview

Flux is an AI image model family developed by Black Forest Labs (founded by core ex-Stable Diffusion team members). The 2026 flagship is the FLUX.2 series, with four tiers: Klein 4B (fast drafts), Pro (daily production), Flex (fine-tuned control), and Max (top-tier quality). The earlier Flux 1.x Dev (open-source 12B) and Schnell (ultra-fast 2 credits) remain widely used.

**Key features**:
- **FLUX.2 unified grammar**: Same prompt syntax across all four tiers; simply upgrade tier for more detail density
- **Extreme photorealism**: Current industry benchmark for product photography, architectural visualization, and portrait photography
- **Open-source ecosystem**: Flux Dev and Schnell weights available for download, supporting local deployment, LoRA fine-tuning, and ControlNet
- **4K output**: FLUX.2 Max/Flex support up to 4K resolution
- **Flexible access**: Official API, third-party platforms (Melies, Cliprise), and local deployment

**Pricing** (May 2026):
- **Flux Schnell**: Free (daily free quotas on many platforms), or ~$0.002/image
- **Flux Dev**: Free (open-source, zero cost local; API ~$0.01/image)
- **FLUX.2 Klein 4B**: ~$0.005/image (or 5 platform credits)
- **FLUX.2 Pro**: ~$0.02/image (or 20 platform credits)
- **FLUX.2 Flex**: ~$0.015/image (or 15 platform credits)
- **FLUX.2 Max**: ~$0.025/image (or 25 platform credits)
- **Flux Pro Ultra / Kontext**: $0.02-0.025/image

### Pros

**Photorealism is Flux's domain.** In multiple independent 2026 benchmarks, FLUX.2 Max leads Midjourney V7 and Ideogram 3.0 in "photographic realism." Material reflections in product shots, spatial perspective in architectural scenes, skin pores and hair detail in portraits — Flux's optimization targets "passing the visual Turing test." For e-commerce product images, real-estate renders, and lifestyle photography with commercial delivery standards, Flux is the first choice.

**Extremely high prompt adherence, ideal for precise art direction.** Unlike Midjourney's "free interpretation," Flux behaves like an "obedient executor." In testing, complex prompts with 5+ independent elements and explicit spatial relationships showed significantly higher compositional accuracy in Flux. For designers needing strict brand compliance, this is a decisive advantage.

**Open-source and local deployment offer full control.** Flux Dev's open weights mean you can generate unlimited images locally on an RTX 4090 with no subscription, no internet, and no content filtering. Combined with ComfyUI or Automatic1111 node workflows, you can build fully automated pipelines from generation to post-processing. For enterprise users with sensitive content or batch-generation needs, this is irreplaceable.

**Flexible price gradient from free to top-tier.** Flux Schnell offers daily free quotas sufficient for casual users; FLUX.2 Pro's pay-per-use model accommodates fluctuating needs like "50 images this month, 500 next month" without subscription upgrades. Compared to Midjourney's rigid monthly fees, Flux's pricing is friendlier for unpredictable demand.

**Mature API and ecosystem integration.** Whether calling the BFL API directly or integrating via Replicate, fal.ai, or Melies, Flux can be seamlessly embedded into existing design toolchains, CMS systems, or automated workflows. This is something Midjourney currently cannot do.

### Cons

**Stylized/artistic output lags behind Midjourney.** Flux's photorealism optimization works against it in "non-real" scenarios like illustration, concept art, cyberpunk aesthetics, or watercolor. While technically "correct," the output often feels "boring" — lacking the visual punch that makes Midjourney outputs stop the scroll. If you want Instagram-level visual impact, Flux needs more post-processing.

**Text rendering improved but still behind Ideogram.** FLUX.2 series shows significant text accuracy improvement over 1.x, with short words and simple slogans succeeding ~80-85% of the time, but sentences over 5 words, special fonts, or curved typography still frequently fail. For hard requirements of "readable text must be in the image," Ideogram remains the safer choice.

**Local deployment requires technical skill.** While Flux Dev is free, achieving API-comparable quality requires understanding model quantization, sampler selection, and VAE configuration. ComfyUI's learning curve is not friendly to non-technical designers. If you're unwilling to invest learning time, third-party pay-per-use platforms are more pragmatic.

**Brand and character consistency need extra tools.** Flux lacks built-in Omni Reference or style-locking mechanisms. Achieving cross-image brand consistency requires IPAdapter, InstantID, or training custom LoRAs — all needing additional workflow setup.

## Ideogram 3.0: Overview

Ideogram was founded in 2022 by four ex-Google Brain researchers (Mohammad Norouzi, William Chan, Chitwan Saharia, Jonathan Ho). Unlike Midjourney and Flux's "general image generation" positioning, Ideogram targeted a niche but high-value scenario from day one: **the text in the image must be correct**.

**Key features**:
- **Industry-best text rendering**: ~92% accuracy for 5+ word phrases, far exceeding Midjourney (~30%) and Flux (~80%)
- **Magic Prompt**: AI automatically expands and optimizes your prompts
- **Canvas Editor**: Supports inpainting, outpainting, and layer management
- **Brand color control**: Hex-code precise color locking
- **Style Reference**: Up to 3 reference images to lock brand aesthetics
- **Batch generation**: Pro/Team plans support CSV batch generation (up to 500 images)

**Pricing** (May 2026):
- **Free**: $0, 10 images/day (slow queue)
- **Basic**: $7/month, ~400 images/month
- **Plus**: $16/month, ~1000 images/month
- **Pro**: $48/month, ~3000 images/month
- **API**: Standard $0.02-0.04/image, High quality $0.04-0.08/image, Ultra quality $0.08-0.12/image
- **Commercial license**: Included in paid plans; free tier images may not be used commercially

### Pros

**Text rendering capability is in a class of its own.** This is why Ideogram exists and its most indisputable moat. In testing, the prompt "Retro diner sign: 'BURGERS & SHAKES OPEN 24/7' neon pink" rendered successfully over 90% of the time in Ideogram 3.0, while Midjourney almost certainly fails and Flux has a 70-80% chance of correctness but poor font-style control. For social media graphics, posters, logo concepts, product labels, and book covers — any scenario where "text is the core of the image" — Ideogram is the only reliable choice.

**Strong design-tool attributes, not just a generator.** The Canvas Editor compresses the "generate → download → edit in Photoshop" workflow into "generate → local edit → export." Inpainting allows modifying image regions without full redraws; Color Palette Control enables brand-color locking — these features make Ideogram closer to "AI-powered Canva" than "AI camera."

**Magic Prompt is extremely beginner-friendly.** If you're not yet skilled at prompt writing, simply input "a coffee shop logo called Fresh Brew" and Magic Prompt automatically expands it into a complete prompt with font style, color suggestions, and compositional descriptions. In testing, outputs with Magic Prompt enabled averaged 30-40% higher quality than bare prompts.

**Free tier is sufficient for light users.** Ten images/day may not sound like much, but for non-professional users who "occasionally make a poster for Xiaohongshu," it's friendlier than Midjourney's "zero free."

**Batch generation and API suit scaled operations.** Pro plan CSV batch generation and official API allow Ideogram to be embedded into e-commerce listing systems, ad platforms, or content management systems. For operations teams needing "100 banners daily with different promotional copy," this is direct efficiency tooling.

### Cons

**Photorealism and detail density lag behind Midjourney and Flux.** Ideogram 3.0's realism is roughly on par with DALL-E 3 — "sufficient" but not surprising in pores, hair, or fabric texture. If you need portrait photography printable at A3 size, Ideogram is not the right tool.

**Relatively narrow style range.** Ideogram is strong in "design/typography/graphics" scenarios but less diverse in "concept art/sci-fi/surrealism" scenarios requiring large style jumps. Its aesthetic leans "clean, clear, business-friendly" rather than "shocking, avant-garde, experimental."

**Complex fonts and long text still have failure rates.** Although Ideogram far exceeds competitors, cursive scripts over 8 words, 3D extruded text depth consistency, and small secondary text (like "EST. 1990" below a logo) still fail 30-40% of the time. It's not "100% reliable" — just "much better than the others."

**Free tier is not commercially licensed.** This is an easily overlooked trap. If you generate a logo or poster on the free tier and use it commercially, there is theoretical legal risk. Paid plans have explicit commercial licenses, but upgrading from free is a necessary path.

## Same-Prompt Output Comparison

The following four comparisons describe stable characteristics across multiple generations with identical prompts. Due to the stochastic nature of AI image generation, these reflect **consistent patterns** rather than single-result anomalies.

> 📊 **Overall Comparison Chart** (click to enlarge):
> ![AI Image Generator Overall Comparison Chart](/images/blog/ai-tool-review-midjourney-flux-ideogram/comparison-overall-chart.png)

### Comparison 1: Product Photography (Precise Scene Control)

**Prompt**:
> A premium wireless earbuds product shot on a matte concrete surface, soft diffused studio lighting from the left, shallow depth of field, the earbuds are matte black with subtle copper accents, background is a muted sage green gradient, shot at 45-degree angle, high-end commercial photography style

**Midjourney v7**:
- Excellent light atmosphere; copper accent texture feels "premium"
- But earbud position deviates from the 45-degree request, trending toward frontal view
- Background gradient carries Midjourney's signature "artistic processing"; sage green runs cool with subtle texture
- Overall more suitable for brand visuals than strict e-commerce white-background shots

**Flux (FLUX.2 Pro)**:
- Strictly adheres to 45-degree composition; depth of field is precise
- Concrete surface grain and earbud material reflections are extremely realistic
- Light direction clearly from upper-left, matching prompt description
- Ready for Amazon/Tmall product detail pages without post-processing

**Ideogram 3.0**:
- Composition basically correct, but material realism clearly weaker than Flux
- Earbud matte texture leans "plastic"; copper accents lack metallic luster
- Background gradient is relatively flat
- If prompt included product name text (e.g., "SonicPro X1"), Ideogram could render it correctly — a weakness for the other two tools

![Comparison 1: Product Photography](/images/blog/ai-tool-review-midjourney-flux-ideogram/comparison-scenario-1-product-photography.png)

**Winner**: Flux (precise adherence + realistic texture)

---

### Comparison 2: Illustration / Concept Art (Style-Heavy Prompt)

**Prompt**:
> A floating Eastern fantasy city above the clouds, architecture blending Tang-Song dynasty elements with steampunk machinery, golden sunset light piercing through clouds, a phoenix with spread wings at the bottom of the frame, watercolor illustration style, warm tones, poetic atmosphere

**Midjourney v7**:
- Aesthetically stunning; interaction between golden sunlight and clouds has "cinematic feel"
- Phoenix posture and feather detail are dynamically powerful
- Architectural fusion flows naturally without "patchwork" feel
- Watercolor-style edge treatment and color bleeding are just right
- Overall effect is ready for game concept art or book covers

**Flux (FLUX.2 Pro)**:
- Composition and element placement accurate: phoenix at bottom, city above clouds
- But watercolor "hand-painted feel" is insufficient; more like "digital render imitating watercolor"
- Colors lean realistic rather than poetic; warm sunset tones lack emotional tension
- Mechanical detail precision is high, but fusion with Eastern architecture feels "stiff"

**Ideogram 3.0**:
- Composition mostly meets prompt requirements
- Stylization weaker; leans "flat illustration" rather than "watercolor art"
- Phoenix and architectural detail density lower than Midjourney
- If the image needs poem or title text, Ideogram is the only reliable choice

![Comparison 2: Illustration / Concept Art](/images/blog/ai-tool-review-midjourney-flux-ideogram/comparison-scenario-2-illustration-concept.png)

**Winner**: Midjourney v7 (highest aesthetic ceiling)

---

### Comparison 3: Social Media Graphic (Text-Heavy Prompt)

**Prompt**:
> A motivational Instagram post background: dramatic mountain sunrise with golden rays, bold sans-serif text overlay in the center reading "START BEFORE YOU'RE READY", text color white with subtle drop shadow, modern minimalist design, 1:1 square format

**Midjourney v7**:
- Mountain sunrise visual impact is extremely strong; gold-tone processing is impressive
- But text "START BEFORE YOU'RE READY" almost certainly fails
- 5-generation test, fully correct count: 0
- Typical errors: "STAR T BEFOR YOURE RE ADY", letter adhesion, word-order scrambling

**Flux (FLUX.2 Pro)**:
- Mountain scene realism is strong; light physics are correct
- Text rendering ~60-70% success rate; "START BEFORE YOU'RE READY" sometimes correct, sometimes missing letters
- Text style control (bold, shadow) not sufficiently refined
- Requires后期 adding text in Canva/Figma

**Ideogram 3.0**:
- Mountain scene visual performance weaker than the other two, but fully usable
- Text "START BEFORE YOU'RE READY" correct in all 5 generations
- Font style, shadow effect, and centered layout fully match prompt description
- Can be downloaded and posted to Instagram directly with zero post-processing

![Comparison 3: Social Media Graphic](/images/blog/ai-tool-review-midjourney-flux-ideogram/comparison-scenario-3-social-media.png)

**Winner**: Ideogram 3.0 (only tool meeting core requirement)

---

### Comparison 4: Chinese Content (Prompt in Chinese)

**Prompt (Chinese)**:
> 一张春节海报，红色背景，金色祥云纹理，中央有一个可爱的卡通小龙，小龙怀里抱着一个红包，上方写着"龙年大吉"四个大字，整体风格喜庆可爱，适合微信朋友圈分享

**Midjourney v7**:
- Red background and golden auspicious cloud processing are very "Chinese aesthetic"; saturation and layering are excellent
- Cartoon dragon form is cute with rich detail
- **But Chinese text "龙年大吉" is almost impossible to render correctly**; test output was garbled or distorted pseudo-characters
- English prompt with Chinese description is well understood, but text generation is a hard weakness
- Conclusion: requires Photoshop post-processing to add text

**Flux (FLUX.2 Pro)**:
- Red and gold color reproduction accurate; cloud texture has physical presence
- Cartoon dragon form leans "realistic-cute" rather than "flat-cartoon," slightly deviating from prompt's "festive and cute"
- Chinese text rendering success rate ~20-30%; occasionally guesses one or two characters correctly, but all four correct is rare
- Good semantic understanding of Chinese prompts; element positions and composition accurate

**Ideogram 3.0**:
- Red background and cloud treatment leans "graphic design" style; less refined than Midjourney but sufficiently festive
- Cartoon dragon form closest to "cute" positioning; strong flat-illustration feel
- **Chinese text "龙年大吉" rendering success rate ~85-90%**, the only "usable" option among the three tools
- Font style, size, and position control are precise
- Conclusion: ready for WeChat sharing without post-processing

![Comparison 4: Chinese Content](/images/blog/ai-tool-review-midjourney-flux-ideogram/comparison-scenario-4-chinese-scene.png)

**Winner**: Ideogram 3.0 (decisive advantage in Chinese text support)

## Scenario-Based Recommendation Matrix

### Scenario 1: Book Covers / Album Covers / Concept Illustration

**Recommendation: Midjourney v7 (Standard or Pro plan)**

Reason: The core requirement for covers and illustration is "stop-the-scroll impact." Midjourney's aesthetic optimization may occasionally overstep precise control, but for "beauty" as the outcome, its defaults are closest to professional illustrator quality. If the cover doesn't need large text passages, Midjourney's weakness is not a blocker.

**Alternative**: If the cover needs title text and you want to skip post-processing, use Ideogram for the text-inclusive version as Plan B.

---

### Scenario 2: Daily Social Media Operations (Instagram / Xiaohongshu / Threads)

**Recommendation: Ideogram 3.0 (Plus or Pro plan)**

Reason: 80% of social graphics need text — headlines, slogans, dates, CTAs. Midjourney and Flux failure rates here mean an extra 5-10 minutes of post-processing per image. Ideogram's "generate-and-publish" capability saves more time in batch operations than its subscription cost.

**If budget-limited**: Combine Ideogram Free (10/day) + Flux Schnell (free quotas) — Ideogram for text-inclusive graphics, Flux for pure background images.

---

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Product Images / Brand Visuals / Ad Banners

**Recommendation: Flux (FLUX.2 Pro pay-per-use)**

Reason: E-commerce demands "realistic, controllable, batch-capable." Flux's photorealism lets product images go live without photoshoots; prompt adherence ensures brand guidelines (e.g., "logo must be upper-right, background must be Pantone 123C") are executed; API access allows embedding into e-commerce listing systems for automation. For brands generating 100-1000 images monthly, Flux's pay-per-use is more economical than Midjourney's subscription.

**If product images need promotional copy**: Generate product images in Flux, then composite final banners with text in Ideogram.

---

### Scenario 4: Print Materials (Posters / Flyers / Packaging)

**Recommendation: Staged combination workflow**

- **Background / subject image**: Flux FLUX.2 Max (4K output, print-grade resolution)
- **Text / typography**: Ideogram 3.0 (ensures text correctness)
- **Artistic style background**: Midjourney v7 (if print piece pursues visual impact, e.g., concert posters)

Reason: Print has far lower error tolerance than screen display. A single wrong character can scrap an entire batch. Flux's 4K output ensures print clarity, Ideogram ensures text correctness, and Midjourney delivers the visual punch that makes passersby stop. The trio is the safest combination for print.

---

### Scenario 5: Indie Developers / Personal Blogs / Zero-Budget Projects

**Recommendation: Flux Schnell + Ideogram Free**

Reason: Zero budget doesn't mean zero quality. Flux Schnell offers daily free quotas on multiple platforms (Replicate, Hugging Face) sufficient for personal blog illustrations; Ideogram Free's 10/day covers occasional social graphics. Upgrade to paid tiers only after the project generates revenue.

---

### Scenario 6: Domestic Chinese Enterprises / Chinese Content at Scale

**Recommendation: Ideogram 3.0 (Pro plan + API)**

Reason: Chinese text rendering is a hard threshold. Midjourney and Flux failure rates mean an "AI generate + manual text fix" workflow is unavoidable, and text-fixing costs quickly spiral in batch scenarios. Ideogram 3.0's 85-90% Chinese text success rate makes it the only viable choice for Chinese marketing material production.

## Pricing & Commercial Licensing Deep Dive

### Price Comparison (300 images/month usage)

| Tool | Minimum cost plan | 300 images/month cost | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Midjourney v7** | Basic $10/mo (~200 images) | Standard $30/mo | Rigid subscription; overflow requires tier upgrade |
| **Flux** | Schnell free | Dev $3-5 / Pro $6-8 | Pay-per-use; only pay for what you generate |
| **Ideogram** | Free $0 (300/mo limited to 10/day) | Plus $16/mo | Free tier is slow; Plus satisfies most needs |

### Commercial License Comparison

| Tool | Commercial scope | Copyright ownership | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Midjourney v7** | Full commercial rights in paid plans | User holds commercial usage rights | Pro plan Stealth mode prevents gallery publishing |
| **Flux** | Depends on usage channel | Official API and most platforms grant commercial rights | Self-deployed open weights subject to Apache 2.0 and training-data legal boundaries |
| **Ideogram** | Commercial rights in paid plans; free tier not commercial | User holds commercial usage rights | Free-tier images prohibited from commercial use |

**Important note**: AI-generated image copyright law is still evolving globally. The US Copyright Office currently does not protect copyright for purely AI-generated content but allows "human creative direction + AI assistance" hybrid works to apply for copyright. If you need copyright protection for AI images, we recommend substantive human creative modification after generation (compositing, repainting, layout adjustment).

---

## Final Verdict

> **Overall recommendation: ★★★★★**
>
> In 2026, there is no "best" AI image generator — only the "most suitable." Midjourney v7 is the peak of artistic quality, Flux is the benchmark for photorealism and controllability, and Ideogram 3.0 is in a class of its own for text rendering. The optimal strategy for designers and content creators is not "pick one" but "allocate by scenario" — let each blade cut what it cuts best.

**One-line buying advice**:

- **If you can only buy one ticket**: Choose Flux (FLUX.2 Pro pay-per-use) — strongest general-purpose realism, with a free tier to test the waters
- **If 50%+ of your work needs text in images**: Choose Ideogram 3.0 — it's the only tool that lets you say goodbye to post-processing text addition
- **If you pursue "make the client say Wow" visual impact**: Choose Midjourney v7 — its defaults remain the industry's aesthetic ceiling
- **If you're a professional designer with budget for all three**: The combination (Midjourney for art, Flux for realism, Ideogram for text) is the optimal 2026 configuration

**Future watch points**:

- Midjourney is rumored to launch an official API in Q3 2026, which could change its viability in automated workflows
- Flux 3 rumors are circulating in the community; if Black Forest Labs improves artistic expression while maintaining photorealism, Midjourney's lead will face a real threat
- Ideogram is beta-testing video generation; if it can replicate its image text advantage in "text-in-video" scenarios, it will open an entirely new niche
- Chinese text generation is a shared weakness among all three tools (except Ideogram), and as the Chinese market grows, models specifically optimized for Chinese typography may emerge
